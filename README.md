c-examples
==========

My implementations of a shell, who command and some stuff in c I've done for practising. The code is over-commented, which helped me when learning. Also, it is in Spanish, file an issue if you want it translated. Hope you enjoy my C-fu! 

### my_who
Implementation of unix "who" CLI command. There are 3 versions of it (my_who1, my_who2 & my_who3) each with more options than the former. 

### my_Shell
Implementation of a little bash-like interactive shell. quite fun!

### my_alarms
Implementations of an alarm scheduler command, for practising with pthread mutexes and conditional variables.
